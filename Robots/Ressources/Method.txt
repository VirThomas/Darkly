It is important to know that configuratin files can grant an attacker some
information about security and filesystem. In this case, robots.txt is a file
that tells search engines which directories not to look at, which can also give
some information about what the developper don't want to be public.

1. Access to Robots file: /robots.txt
2. There is a folder listed, called /whatever which is protected
3. Navigate to /whatever and download the file htpasswd
4. Inside the file you can read "root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3"
5. Decoding the hash gets you the password: dragon
6. Use root/dragon and username/password in /admin to get the flag
