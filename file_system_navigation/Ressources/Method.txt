Application or server running can have privileged access to the file-system.
The exploit consists in using those privileges to access system files
that you couldn't normally access to.

1. Navigate into the file tree by steps:
   - /../
   - /../../
   - /../../../
   - /../../../../
   - /../../../../../
2. Look for important files like /etc/passwd (And get the flag)
   Access to system files can lead to new exploits on the system
