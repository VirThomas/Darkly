Forms and parameters passed to server need back-end validation. Otherwise, they
can be arbitrarily modified by users. In this example, we have a voting form
which value can be easily modified manually.

1. Navigate to /index.php?page=survey
2. Inspect elements: they form stores the value of your vote
   inside an HTML tag parameter in the front side.
3. Modify the value of one of the select options for a big number of your choice
4. Select that option to vote. Get the flag.
